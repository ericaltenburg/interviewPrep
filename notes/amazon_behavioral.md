# Why Amazon?

When I first started college I had the pleasure of talking to Stephen Orban who currently works at AWS about Amazon in general and what they stood for. He told me about his experience being there and how he was able to develop his career and work with some of the smartest people he's ever met. He also told me about the leadership principles that are deeply involved with Amazon's culture, and after reading more about it, I found that I aligned with them as well and wanted to be be surrounded by those who felt the same way. 

Throughout my academic career, I have always strived to maintain the highest standards I can hold myself to through assignments, hackathons, and even my hobbies. Additionally, my drive to constantly learn led to me transferring out of my community college and into Stevens Institute of Technology. I felt as though my curiousity with computer science out-grew what was being offered so I began to look for programs which would help fill this desire for knowledge I had. So to have some of these principles shape me into who I am now, I feel as though working with people who feel the same way would be incredibly rewarding. 

# Tell me about yourself?

Growing up, I was the type of person who felt it was my responsibility to take the intiative. For example, if a question was asked to a whole group of people, regardless of everyone around me, I would feel the need to answer it. I feel like his sense of initiative has contributed to the success of everything I've worked on. Whenever the opportunity arises, I simply love developing a plan and seeing the whole project through making sure it's completed in the best way possible while making sure everyone involved is completely satsified with what was created.

# Leadership Principles

Important:

customer obsession, dive deep, ownership

## Customer Obsession:

Problem: At my college, everyone is required to complete a year long project for their senior year. My team was working with a client that wanted to create a product which would rival Zillow and their tool to help customers figure out the hidden costs to buying houses.

Action: Our customer obsession led us to search for possible reasons why when using Zillow, the pricing may differ from actual costs to the consumer. This research led to the realization that the accuracy on housing taxes was something that was really desirable and Zillow fell short on that. To solve this, I took lead of the project and worked closely with my team to aggregate multiple sources of public tax data for New Jersey. 

Result: After obtaining this large data set, I helped in creating a linear regression model to accurately predict the taxes for a homeowner. Then I ensured this was deployed on a React App to demo to my team's client. Additionally, since we aggregated such a large amount of tax data, we were then able to make an API that served this data allowing us to market another product.

## Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit:
## Deep Dive

Problem: During my time at Texas State University as an undergrad research assistant, my partner and I were tasked with predicting battery consumption for drones pre-flight. My mentor was not too keen on machine learning and simply wanted to model the power consumption for one given battery with respect to time. I began to do a deep dive on lithium ion batteries and learned they were not as predictable as they aged so instead, I proposed an idea where we use machine learning to predict the consumption.

Action: I explained that with respect to time, the age of battery would become a dependent variable in the prediction of battery consumption, so instead I proposed instead to predict the maneuvers a drone would perform during it's flight which we could then calcualte how much power it would use while it performed said maneuver. I tasked myself with creating the machine learning model which used a classifier decision tree and my partner who was more experienced with mathematic models was tasked with modeling the power consumptions for maneuvers.

Result: The model was able to predict a drone's flight path with an accuracy of 95% which I was then able to convert to a timeline of maneuvers during a flight. Then using the models my partner created, we simply guaged how much power would be consumed giving us the battery consumption prediction.

## Bias for action:

Problem: During my most hectic semester I was taking the maximum amount of credits allowed while working a job at the library as an assistant. In order to maintain a healthy lifestyle and mindset while upholding my GPA, I constantly had to take risks in how I wanted to allocate my time.

Action: I constantly needed to calculate how I wanted to study and what I wanted to study for if I had a series of back to back exams. I developed the ability to recognize the most important topics I needed to study for this way I could have efficient study periods and a timely sleep pattern. Additionally, I would have to strategically plan the days in which I was training for my powerlifting meet based on my constantly changing exam and project schedules this way I could meet up with teams.

Result: I was able to maintain my hours at my job at the library, keep a stable sleep schedule for the entire semester meaning no all nighters, maintained my competitive GPA, and still participate in my hobbies outside of the classroom like my powerlifting meet.

## Ownership

Problem: Throughout my time at Stevens I helped teach a handful of courses like Algorithms, Fundamentals of Programming Languages, and the Software Development Process. While I would be holding office hours to provide extra help to students in the Software Development Process, I would notice they might not understand an idea from a previous class which I either took or helped teach previously.

Action: I would spend a little extra time if I didn't have a class or meeting to futher help the students with a certain data structure or algorithm if they did not understand it.

Result: As a result, I was still able to complete my office hours while helping those who needed help with the software development process, but I was also able to provide extra help to those who were taking a class that I previously taught or took.

# Phone Screen Questions

1. How has your career developed as you've spent your time here?
#. How was the work life balance as an engineer especially during the pandemic?
#. Do the projects you work on generally stay contained within teams at your office location or do you occasionally work with teams from other office locations? (i.e. Team in Seattle working with one in Boston)
#. Does each team use their own software development process? Like does each team use their own flavor of agile or is it pretty uniform across teams.
#. Why did you choose to work at Amazon?
#. What does your day to day look like?
#. What sort of projects have you worked on?
