# Personality Notes with Professor Dool \hfill June 8, 2021

## Phone interview (screening):
- Their goal is to verify credentials and get first impression of me
- They will likely ask a few questions, usually not much
	- Keep it mind that this could knock me out or keep going through the process
- They may dive into technical knowledge, my experience at Stevens, and any relevant job experience
- Prepping for the phone interview:
	- Go over my resume, have it in front of me, keep track of what's on my resume this way there are no surprise questions
	- Find any info on the role I applied for
		- See what technical skills are needed for the position, and try to match it up to me and my resume
		- If I do match a technical skill, have it handy and show that I have it
			- Give an example as to how I have knowledge with that technical skill
	- Find similar person's resume and size up my own resume
		- This will also help to see what technical skills they might be looking for
	- **Think about 2 or 3 questions ahead of time**
		- I might be given the opportunity to ask questions
		- EX: 
			- "I noticed during the interview there was a focus on __ (DP) __, how might this be used on the job?"
		- **DO HW AND ASK QUESTIONS WITH WHAT THEY DO**
		- Be enthusiastic, upbeat, positive, and courteous (i.e. "thank for time and interview", "I'm looking forward to hearing from you/continuing with the application process")
			- Play the role of the interviewee

## Zoom interview:
- If I get to next round, call him back!
- EX:
	1. One person was in casual clothes, living room, sitting relaxed in a lounge chair, nothing in the background
	2. Other has shirt and tie, Rutger's background, better impression
		- Treat both this and the phone interview as if I'm going into the office
- Other variables make this less straight forward: one-on-one, it depends!
