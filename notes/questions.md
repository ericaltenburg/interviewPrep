# Interview Flor \hfill \today

## Jane Street

### Elevator pitch
- Hi, my name is Eric Altenburg, and I am a recent graduate from Stevens Insitute of Technology. I majored in computer science with a minor in mathematics. Two summers ago I was a research assistant at Texas State University working on battery consumption prediction for drones pre-flight. I was also a course assistant for a few courses such as algorithms and programming languages which was how I found out about Jane Street because we use OCaml and Dune to build up our own interpreters and type checking systems. Right now, I'm looking for a full-time position where I can take the knowledge and experiences I've gained over these past few years to develop some software that has some meaningful impact. 

### Flow
1. Repeat question back to understand
2. Ask questions about input types
    1. Is the input sorted?
    2. Are there repeated elements?
    3. How does the output look if it's repeated?
    4. If no solution, what should I return?
    5. How many users do we expect?
    6. Trade-offs: Increase space to be faster?
3. Ask for sample input/output
4. Solve problem by hand
5. Explain the solution
6. Analyize it in Big(O)
7. Find bottlenecks and try to come up with something more efficient
8. Implement

### Test cases
- “Happy path”
- Edge cases
- Empty/null input
- Repeated elements

### Questions
1. In the get to know us videos, I saw the big rows that allowed for easy collaboration. Also, another point that a lot of the workers said was that people were always willing to help if you had an interesting problem. With covid, did you find that it's harder to reach out to coworkers and achieve this level of collaboration?
2. I read online that the engineers tend to use a lot of libraries created in house. Does this mean you generally don't use packages from OPAM?
3. What sort of software development cycle do you use? Agile?
4. What is the OCaml bootcamp like? I read some of the jane street blogs and it almost reminds me of a lecture hall.
- "I noticed during the interview there was a focus on __ (DP) __, how might this be used on the job?"

### Final thank yous
- Thank you for your time and the interview
- I'm looking forward to (i.e. “thank for time and interview”, “I’m
looking forward to hearing from you/continuing with the application process”)
