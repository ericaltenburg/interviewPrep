how skilled i am
how much my github and portfolio can show my tech abilities

as SWE, many places that need my talent

worked at mindtree (he worked in design)
- on any project, it's client facing, JPM, GME, AON, 
- usually have a problem, removing legacy code
- can namedrop and say that I worked for you before
- groups are broke up into certain groups
- depends on project: 
	- AON: year of development, 3 months of interaction with dev team, 
	- some element of guidance
- 

Marlabs:
	- focused on upcoming tech (crypto, ar/vr, iot)
	- this is smaller (make 100mil revenue)

Do: finance/actuary insurance (right now)

Don't: ppl hire for CRUD (just building)

improve something

articulate myself

I can communicate

design and dev reviews are similar

they will ask 2 to 3 projects, don't want gaping holes in my projects

how can I make my portfolio stand out even more

Google, microsoft, and amzon: all his portfolio

spend a couple months making portfolio the best it can

just focus on one place

what if i change this requirement, how would I change it?

- when interviewed at google, 
- knew they were interviewing at firebase
- went on linked in, looked at job description (this is the designer of firebase)
- wrote message to them, applied, wanted to reach out

if this is not the correct person to reach out to, please direct me. Here's my resume, I hope you consider me, I am interested in X.

can I get the name of the interviewer so I can get the background of that person

talk about how i can make it better

be honest, I think this can be made better blah blah blah, moving forward I would do this

think about past projects, how it can be improved, jot down points about projects with how it can be better
