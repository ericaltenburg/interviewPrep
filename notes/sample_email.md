Subject: Stevens Student Seeking Advice

Good Morning Ms./Mr./Mrs.,

My name is Eric and I am currently a senior at Stevens Institute of Technology studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I found you on LinkedIn and saw that you are a fellow Stevens Alum at Company X. I am reaching out because I am interested in pursuing a career as a software engineer.

Given your background in the field, I would be grateful if you could spare 20 minutes for a short conversation to get your advice. Please let me know if you would be willing to talk.

I have attached my resume below as a source of background information on myself.

Best Regards,

Eric Altenburg
